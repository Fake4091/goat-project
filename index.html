    <h1>My GOAT</h1>

        The GOAT of singing and making music in my opinion has to be Ado. She is
        a japanese singer who is known for their impressive vocal performances,
        both in the vocal booth, and even more so on stage. She debuted in 2020
        at only 17 years old with her single "Usseewa," and has been releasing
        new songs and some covers frequently ever since. She has kept her face
        hidden during performances, only showing her silhouette. Pictured to the
        right is her character, which is used in promotional art as well as most
        of her album, EP, and single cover art.
